When examining the search tree at the level 1
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  1 th feature
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  2 th feature
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  3 th feature
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  4 th feature
We can eliminate the feature 2 from the current features resulting in an accuracy:  0.9466666666666667
When examining the search tree at the level 2
[1, 3, 4]
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  1 th feature
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  3 th feature
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  4 th feature
We can eliminate the feature 1 from the current features resulting in an accuracy:  0.9666666666666667
When examining the search tree at the level 3
[3, 4]
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  3 th feature
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  4 th feature
We can eliminate the feature 3 from the current features resulting in an accuracy:  0.88
When examining the search tree at the level 4
[4]
Verifying the possiblity of removing the  4 th feature
We can eliminate the feature 4 from the current features resulting in an accuracy:  0.3333333333333333
After considering all features, the resulting feature set is [3, 4] which exhibits an accuarcy:  0.9666666666666667
